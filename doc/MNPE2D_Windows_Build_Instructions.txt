Instructions for building MNPE2D on Windows 10

The following assumes the user is developing code in the folder C:\dev, but any folder can be chosen.

1) Get MNPE source code.

Option A) Click the download link at https://gitlab.nps.edu/kbsmith/mnpe2d, select .zip, download the file, copy it to C:\dev, and unzip. 

Option B) Install git from https://git-scm.com/download/win Then open a cmd.exe command window and type 

cd C:\dev
git clone https://gitlab.nps.edu/kbsmith/mnpe2d.git MNPE2D

At the end of this step you should have a folder C:\dev\MNPE2D

2) Install CMake

Download latest version from https://cmake.org/download/ Click the .msi link next to "Windows win64-x64 Installer" to run the installation program.

3) Install MinGW

Go to https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/ Click the button to download mingw-get-setup.exe Choose C:\MinGW\ for the installation directory. When the MinGW Installation Manager comes up, select "Basic Setup" in the left-hand pane, then in the upper-right pane, check the boxes for 

mingw-developer-toolkit-bin
mingw32-base-bin
mingw32-gcc-fortran-bin
mingw32-gcc-c++-bin 
msys-base-bin

Then on the menu bar select Installation->Apply Changes

4) Build MNPE2D

Run the MSYS shell from C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat and in its window type

cd C:/dev/MNPE2D/bin (notice that the MSYS shell uses forward slashes)
cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" ../src
make

You will now have MNPE2D.exe in the bin\ folder. Test it by typing

cd ../benchmark
../bin/MNPE2D

MNPE2D.exe can now be executed from a regular cmd.exe command window or by double-clicking in the Windows explorer.
